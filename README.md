# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of the Analysis
This analysis is imtended to help the company PyBer, a Python-based ridesharing app company, to get a better understanding of its operations. In other words, which area or type of rider is generating better revenue? are all areas where the company operating well covered? should there be an opportunity to raise por lower fare? do we have too many drivers in one area as opposed to another? . This analysis will help answer these questions and helped the CEO make strategic decisions. 


After doing this analysis, we could gather a lot of valuable information that will definitely help PyBer to become one of the best ridesharing app companies by using resources such as data analysis.

Results
Using the information from the CSV files such as the different kinds of cities (Urban, Suburban, Rural) and the date range (January 2019 to April 2019), we can represent in graphs and with percentages on it the following data.

The majority of the rides are concentrated in urban area at 68.4% as opposed to 26.3% in suburban and 5.6% in rural area.  

Furthermore, taking into consideration that the amount of drivers is of great importance for a company to have success, we calculated the total amount of drivers by city type and as a result, Urban cities have a total amount of 2,405 drivers, Suburban cities a total amount of 490, and Rural cities a total amount of 78.

In addition, since the number of drivers and the number of rides is greater in Urban cities than in any other type of city, the total fares that the company gets from those cities are also considerably higher than from Suburban and Rural cities. According to our analysis, the total fare the company gets from Urban cities is $39,854.38, from Suburban cities is $19,356.33, and from Rural cities is $4,327.93.

Despite the fact that everything pointed out Urban cities are the best market for PyBer, this is also related to the fact that average fare per ride is higher and there are more drivers on average compared to the other two areas. 

Based on our analysis, the average fare per ride in the Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities is $24.53, $30.97, and $34.62 respectively. Also, the average fare per driver in the Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities is $16.57, $39.50, and $55.49 respectively as well.

With this information, we can confirme that Urban cities are so far the best market for PyBer and Rural cities the least, due to the differences in fare by ride and driver.


Summary
Finally, taking in consideration the results we could gather from the CSV files, some recommendations we can provide to PyBer are:

Despite Urban cities might be crowded with a lot of rival companies around, PyBer should consider raising the fare per driver since is considerably low compared to Suburban and Rural cities and drivers could consider working for other companies with better offers.

Rural cities are categorized for having long distances places that influence at the moment of using a ride app, so for this case, it would be worth it for PyBer to try to lower its fares since people might try to take another kind of transportation in order to avoid paying expensive rides.

It would be good to consider reducing the number of drivers in Urban cities because compared with the other types of cities where the number of rides is higher than the number of drivers, in Urban cities there are 2,405 drivers that have only accomplished 1,625 rides. This means there are drivers that are not contributing to the success of the company but wasting resources that could be used in better ways.
